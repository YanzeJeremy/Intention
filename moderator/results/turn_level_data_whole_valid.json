I'm planning on doing a lot of hiking, and I need to make sure I have enough energy to keep up with the kids. Firewood is also important, but not as crucial as Food. And as for Water, it's nice to have, but I can always find a stream or a water source if needed.\n\nWhat about you? What are your priorities?"
