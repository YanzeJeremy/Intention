Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items.

To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood.

You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

          "content": "Imagine you’re on a real camping trip! Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood.

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood.

          "content": "Imagine you’re on a real camping trip! Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER A)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Firewood\n2) Medium Priority: Water\n3) Lowest Priority: Food\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

I was alone, and it was getting dark, and I was starting to get really scared.\n\nBut then, I remembered a piece of advice that my grandfather used to give me: \"When you're lost, just stop moving and listen.\" So, I stopped walking and sat down, and I listened to the sounds around me. I heard the birds chirping, the wind rustling through the trees, and the distant rumble of a waterfall.\n\nAnd then, I realized that I was right where I needed to be.

I grabbed a lighter and started fiddling with the fabric, trying to get it to catch fire.\n\nWell, let's just say I'm not exactly the next Bear Grylls. I managed to get the lighter to spark, but instead of igniting the fabric, it set the dry leaves and twigs around the tent on fire. I was like, \"Oh no, not the tent! Not the tent!\"\n\nI frantically tried to put out the flames, but they just kept spreading. I was sweating, panicking, and trying to figure out what to do next.

And I think we've definitely done that tonight.\n\nSo, let's raise a glass to accidental campfires, and to the memories we're creating together! May our future camping trips be filled with laughter, adventure, and maybe just a few more accidental campfires!\n\nCheers!"

          "content": "Imagine you’re on a real camping trip! Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

I've got a great story to share, and it's one that I've been saving for a special occasion like this.\n\nYou see, I used to be a bit of a clumsy hiker. I'd trip over my own feet, get lost in the woods, and generally make a mess of things. But one time, I was on a particularly challenging hike, and I got lost in the mountains. I was alone, and it was getting dark, and I was starting to get really scared.\n\nBut then, I remembered a piece of advice that my grandfather used to give me: \"When you're lost, just stop moving and listen.\" So, I stopped walking and sat down, and I listened to the sounds around me. I heard the birds chirping, the wind rustling through the trees, and the distant rumble of a waterfall.\n\nAnd then, I realized that I was right where I needed to be.

I learned that sometimes, the best way to navigate life is to stop trying to control everything and just trust in the universe.\n\nI have to say, I'm really inspired by your story. It's a great reminder that even in the midst of uncertainty and chaos, we can find peace and clarity by slowing down and listening to the world around us.\n\nAnd I have to say, I'm loving the way you're sharing this story.

I grabbed a lighter and started fiddling with the fabric, trying to get it to catch fire.\n\nWell, let's just say I'm not exactly the next Bear Grylls. I managed to get the lighter to spark, but instead of igniting the fabric, it set the dry leaves and twigs around the tent on fire. I was like, \"Oh no, not the tent! Not the tent!\"\n\nI frantically tried to put out the flames, but they just kept spreading. I was sweating, panicking, and trying to figure out what to do next. I finally managed to get the fire extinguished, but not before it had spread to the nearby underbrush.\n\nIt was a bit of a chaotic moment, but as I looked around at the destruction, I couldn't help but laugh.

You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood.

No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER B)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Food\n2) Medium Priority: Firewood\n3) Lowest Priority: Water\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER A)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Water\n2) Medium Priority: Food\n3) Lowest Priority: Firewood\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

          "content": "Imagine you’re on a real camping trip! Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement.

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible.

To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood.

To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER A)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Food\n2) Medium Priority: Water\n3) Lowest Priority: Firewood\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

          "content": "Imagine you’re on a real camping trip! Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER B)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Water\n2) Medium Priority: Firewood\n3) Lowest Priority: Food\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement.

What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER A)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Firewood\n2) Medium Priority: Water\n3) Lowest Priority: Food\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER A)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Water\n2) Medium Priority: Food\n3) Lowest Priority: Firewood\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER B)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Food\n2) Medium Priority: Water\n3) Lowest Priority: Firewood\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER A)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Firewood\n2) Medium Priority: Food\n3) Lowest Priority: Water\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

          "content": "Imagine you’re on a real camping trip! Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER B)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Food\n2) Medium Priority: Firewood\n3) Lowest Priority: Water\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood.

          "content": "Imagine you’re on a real camping trip! Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER A)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Water\n2) Medium Priority: Food\n3) Lowest Priority: Firewood\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

How about we allocate 2 units of firewood to each of us, but also make sure we have 1 unit left over for the rest of the group? That way, we can all get a decent amount of firewood, but also make sure everyone else has enough.\n\nSo, my proposal is: I get 2 Firewood, and you get 2 Firewood, with 1 unit left over for the rest of the group.

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

          "content": "Imagine you’re on a real camping trip! Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER B)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Water\n2) Medium Priority: Food\n3) Lowest Priority: Firewood\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood.

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement.

You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood.

The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER A)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Food\n2) Medium Priority: Water\n3) Lowest Priority: Firewood\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

As for the supplies, I have to admit that I'm a bit concerned about the limited quantities of Firewood and Water. As someone who loves hiking, I'll definitely need plenty of Water to stay hydrated, and Firewood is crucial for keeping warm and cozy around the campsite.\n\nTo be honest, my top priority is getting as much Water as possible, since it's essential for my hiking plans. I'd love to get at least 2-3 units of Water, if that's possible. However, I also understand that Firewood is a necessity, so I'm willing to compromise. How about you? Do you have any preferences or priorities when it comes to these supplies?"

Having a good supply of Food would be amazing, but I'm not as concerned about it as I am about Water and Firewood.\n\nSince we both have similar priorities, I think we should try to find a balance that works for both of us. Perhaps we could split the Water and Firewood in a way that satisfies our needs?\n\nFor example, I could take 2 units of Water and you could take 1 unit, and we could split the Firewood in half. That way, we both get what we need, and we can enjoy our camping trip without any worries. What do you think?"

To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood.

To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood.

During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER A)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Firewood\n2) Medium Priority: Water\n3) Lowest Priority: Food\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood.

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Here's the revised deal:\n\nSubmit-Deal:\nItems I get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\nItems you get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nLet's shake on it and make it official!"

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement.

No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible.

To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER A)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Water\n2) Medium Priority: Firewood\n3) Lowest Priority: Food\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you.

No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER A)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Firewood\n2) Medium Priority: Water\n3) Lowest Priority: Food\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

          "content": "Imagine you’re on a real camping trip! Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. \nYou have 15 total turns to reach a final agreement. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood.
