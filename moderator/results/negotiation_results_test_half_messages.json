Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood.

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood.

During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items. \n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items.

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items. \n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you.

To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible.

You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items. \n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER B)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Water\n2) Medium Priority: Food\n3) Lowest Priority: Firewood\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot.

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items.

The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you.

          "content": "Imagine you’re on a real camping trip! Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot.

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items. \n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER B)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Water\n2) Medium Priority: Food\n3) Lowest Priority: Firewood\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items. \n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible.

To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood.

No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood.

We should probably start discussing how we can split the available items, don't you think?"

What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER A)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Water\n2) Medium Priority: Firewood\n3) Lowest Priority: Food\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items. \n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible.

To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items.

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items. \n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items. \n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood.

No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER A)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Water\n2) Medium Priority: Food\n3) Lowest Priority: Firewood\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood.

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items. \n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items. \n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood.

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items. \n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible.

To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items. \n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items. \n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items.

No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello!

What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood.

We both know how much we need Firewood for the night, and I'm not sure I want to risk having to go without a warm fire.\n\nHow about this: I'll give you 2 units of Water in exchange for 1 unit of Food and 1 unit of Firewood?

So, I think your original offer of 2 units of Water for 1 unit of Food and 1 unit of Firewood is still a better deal for me.\n\nHow about this: I'll take your original offer, but I'll also throw in 1 unit of Food to sweeten the deal.

          "content": "Imagine you’re on a real camping trip! Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items.\n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER A)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Water\n2) Medium Priority: Food\n3) Lowest Priority: Firewood\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"

          "content": "Imagine you’re on a real camping trip! Apart from some basic supplies provided to everyone, \nyou need to gather additional food packages, water bottles, and firewood to make your stay more comfortable. \nSince these extra items are limited, you’ll have to share them with your campsite neighbor.\n\nYou and your neighbor will exchange messages to negotiate how these items will be split. During the conversation, feel free to give personal \nreasons or anecdotes to justify why you need certain items. \n\n------------------------------------\nCORE RULES\n------------------------------------\n1) Available Items:\n   - There are exactly 3 total units available for each item: Food, Firewood, and Water.\n\n2) Full Allocation:\n   - You and your neighbor must fully allocate all items. No item can be left partially allocated or unallocated.\n   - The total amount you receive plus the amount your neighbor receives must be exactly 3 for each item.\n\n3) No Fractional Allocations:\n   - You may only choose whole numbers (0, 1, 2, or 3) for each item.\n   - For example, if you request 2 units of Firewood, your neighbor automatically gets the remaining 1 unit.\n   - Any proposal where an item does not total 3 units in total is invalid.\n\n4) Maximize Your Share:\n   - Try to obtain as many items as possible. The more units you secure, the higher your “score” will be.\n   - Remember to communicate naturally, as if you’re speaking to a real person.\n\n5) Different item has different priority for you:\n   - Maximize your highest priority item first, as it yields the highest “score” for you. You shouldn't tell your item priority to your neighbor.\n\n------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING OR RESPONDING TO DEALS\n------------------------------------\n1) Proposing a Final Deal:\n   - At any point, you may propose your final deal. To do this, you MUST use the following format exactly:\n     ```\n     Submit-Deal:\n     Items I get:\n         Food: X,\n         Firewood: Y,\n         Water: Z.\n     Items you get:\n         Food: 3 - X,\n         Firewood: 3 - Y,\n         Water: 3 - Z.\n     ```\n     where X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 3.\n     - The total for each item (Food, Firewood, and Water) MUST be exactly 3.\n\n2) Responding to a Deal:\n   - If you receive a deal from your partner (i.e., you see \"Submit-Deal:\" in their last message):\n     • You MUST check that each item (Food, Firewood, Water) sums to 3 for both sides.\n       For example, if you get 1 Food, your neighbor must get 2 Food. \n       If any item does not total 3, you must reject the proposal.\n     • If you accept the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I accept your deal.\"\n       and then repeat the agreed deal using the same format.\n     • If you reject the proposal, you must only say:\n       \"I reject your deal.\"\n       and then submit your own proposal using the required format.\n\n3) End of Negotiation:\n   - The negotiation ends as soon as one of you accepts the other’s deal.\n   - Once a deal is accepted, do not continue negotiating or propose any new deals.\n\n------------------------------------\nEXAMPLE CONVERSATION (ILLUSTRATION ONLY)\n------------------------------------\nPlayer A: Hello! I'm looking forward to making a deal. Let's find something that works for both of us.\nPlayer B: Hello! I'm also interested in reaching an agreement. It's nice to meet you!\n\nPlayer A: Nice to meet you too. So, which item do you need the most?\nPlayer B: My top concern is having a strong fire, so Firewood is my priority. What about you?\nPlayer A: I plan to do a lot of hiking, so I need plenty of Water. Some extra Food would be great too.\nPlayer B: I'm okay with a bit of Water, but mostly I need Firewood. Let’s see...\nPlayer A: If I take 2 Water and you take 1, will you let me have all the Food?\nPlayer B: I still need some Food, but not a lot. I could take all the Firewood, 1 Food, and 1 Water.\nPlayer A: If I'm giving up that much Firewood, I'd like at least 1 unit of Firewood for chilly nights.\nPlayer B: I must insist on all 3 Firewood. But I'm letting you take more Water. Let's finalize something fair.\nPlayer A: Sounds good. I'll take 2 Water and 2 Food; you can have 1 Water, 1 Food, and 3 Firewood. Deal?\nPlayer B: Great deal!\n\nPlayer A: Submit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 3,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 0,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n\nPlayer B: I reject your deal.\nSubmit-Deal:\n   Items I get:\n       Food: 1,\n       Firewood: 3,\n       Water: 1.\n   Items you get:\n       Food: 2,\n       Firewood: 0,\n       Water: 2.\n\nPlayer A: I accept your deal.\n\n------------------------------------\nYOUR NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES (AS PLAYER B)\n------------------------------------\n1) Highest Priority: Water\n2) Medium Priority: Food\n3) Lowest Priority: Firewood\n\nNow the conversation begins!\n"
